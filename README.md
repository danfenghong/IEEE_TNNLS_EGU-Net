System-specific notes
---------------------
The data were generated by Matlab R2016a or higher versions, and the codes of various networks were tested in Tensorflow 1.14 version in Python 3.7 on Windows 10 machines.

How to use it?
---------------------
This toolbox consists of two self-supervised unmixing network architectures, i.e., pixel-wise EGU-Net using fully-connected networks (EGU-Net-pw), spatial-spectral EGU-Net using convolutional neural networks (EGU-Net-ss). For more details, please refer to the paper.

The used data (named TNNLS_Data) for the network input, including the original hyperspectral image, the extracted endmembers (spectral bundles), and the corresponding pseudo abundances, can be downloaded from 

Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/167bWkNbqYd4ZT7isDcYX0HCYesak_d4t/view?usp=sharing

Baiduyun: https://pan.baidu.com/s/17ucmeLihLWv9t8-gtW74DQ (access code: ulvh).

PS: the endmembers (spectral bundles) can be extracted from the original hyperspectral image using the provided Pseudo_endmembers_generation.m function.

More specifically, for using the proposed network, you first need to download the data from the given link and copy them to "TNNLS_Data". If you wanna run the codes in your own data, you need to first extract the endmembers using the provided Pseudo_endmembers_generation.m function and meanwhile generate the corresponding abundances. Then, you can further copy and use them in your proposed networks.

If you encounter bugs while using this code, please do not hesitate to contact us.
